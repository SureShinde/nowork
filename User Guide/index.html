				<h2 class="section-title">Template Installation</h2><br /><br />
				<div class="note">We strongly recommend you to install the theme on a test store first and only then move it to the live store</div>
				<h3 id="prepare-magento" class="sub-title">Prepare your magento</h3>
				<h4>1. Refresh and Disable all the Magento cache</h4>
				<p>When configuring your store, whatever theme or anything else you should <strong>refresh all the Magento cache</strong> and then completely <strong>disable it</strong>. To get it done go to <em class="dfn-code">System -> Cache Management</em></p>
				<h4>2. Reindex magento data</h4>
				<p>After making any changes to magento data (products, categories) you should reindex the data.  To get it done go to <em class="dfn-code">System -> Index Management</em></p>
				<h4>3. Backup Magento files and the store database</h4>
				<p>It saves lot's of your time if something goes wrong. To create backup go to <em class="dfn-code">System-> Tools-> Backups</em></p></p>
				<h4>4. Disable compilation mode</h4>
				<p>To get it done go to <em class="dfn-code">System -> Tools -> Compilation</em></p>
				<h4>5. Disable Merge JavaScript and CSS Files</h4>
				<p>To get it done go to <em class="dfn-code">System -> Configuration -> Developer</em></p>
				<h4>6. Log out from Magento admin panel</h4>
				<p>It must be done to refresh the magento access control system</p>
				<h3 class="sub-title">Upload the theme files</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Using your favourite FTP client upload .zip file <em class="dfn-code">Theme Files/Theme_vX.X.zip</em> from the downloaded package to <strong>the root directory of your magento</strong></li>
					<li>Unzip <em class="dfn-code">Theme_v.X.X.zip</em><br /><br /><div class="note-2">Despite the fact that the .zip file contains the same folders as magento none of the magento core file will be overridden. It was made with the aim to make upload process easier</div></li>
					<li>Version of the magento the theme was created for, you can find on the top of this guide; if you want to use the theme for the different version you should upload theme folders from <em class="dfn-code">Theme Files/Theme_vX.X</em> and then upload patch files located in <em class="dfn-code">Theme Files/patch_for_magento_community_1.x.x.x</em> for specific version of magento</li>
					<li>Set correct file permissions for uploaded folders. More info about file permissions you can find here <a target="_blank" href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/1_-_installation_and_configuration/magento_filesystem_permissions">Magento WIKI: Filesystem permission</a></li>
					<li>Log in to magento admin panel</li>
				</ol>
				<h3 class="sub-title">Install the theme</h3>
				<p>There are two ways how you can get the theme installed and configured</p>
				<h4>Using "1 Click Installation" feature</h4>
				<p>This feature allows you to get your store installed and configured in a few clicks but we <strong>do not recommend using it on live stores</strong> because you can lose your homepage or/and static blocks. This feature is provided only for testing the theme on a test server. To install theme using this feature go to <em class="dfn-code">Meigee -> Activate Theme</em>. In that menu you can mark 2 checkbox in order all static blocks and pages were created automatically and choose store for which theme should be applied. Be aware that if you already created some static blocks or home page with your own content they will be replaced with theme static content in case ID of your blocks and page will match predefined static blocks and pages.</p>
				<h4>Manual Installation</h4>
				<p>This is the only right way of theme's installation if you prefer to install it on live store</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Go to <em class="dfn-code">System -> Configuration -> Design</em> page of your admin panel and set the field "Current Package Name" as <strong>indigo</strong>. Click <strong>Save Config</strong> button</li>
					<li>Create predefined static blocks. All used static blocks you can find under <em class="dfn-code">Sources/Static Content/Blocks</em>, where &lt;FILE NAME&gt; - id of static block, &lt;FILE CONTENT&gt; - content of static block. Your static blocks may have any title</li>
					<li>Create predefined pages. All used pages you can find under <em class="dfn-code">Sources/Static Content/Pages</em>, where &lt;FILE NAME&gt; - id of page, &lt;FILE CONTENT&gt; - content of page. Your pages may have any title. To create the homepage with same content as on demo please refer to <a href="#homepage">Home Page</a> chapter of this guide.</li>
					<li>Upload media folder from <em class="dfn-code">Sources/demo images</em> to the root of your magento. Please notice that real images from preview are not included in the package due to licensing restrictions so are replaced with blank ones</li>
				</ol>
				<h3 class="sub-title">Known problems with installation</h3>
				If you get any problems with theme's installation first of all make sure that you have followed all steps indicated in <a href="#prepare-magento">"Prepare your magento"</a> section. <br /><br />
				<div class="note-2">
					<p><strong>404 Not Found when trying to open theme configuration page</strong><br />
					<em>Solution:</em> It's pretty common issue. Just clear all the magento cache then logout from the admin panel and login again</p>
					<strong>"Package with this name does not exist and cannot be set" error when setting the package name</strong><br />
					<em>Solution 1.</em> Make sure you have uploaded the theme files in the correct way. Note that folders structure of uploaded files must match to the structure of files in downloaded package.</em><br/>
					<em>Solution 2.</em> Check if you have set correct file permissions<br/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div id="general_options" class="post">
				<h2 class="section-title">Theme Options</h2><br /><br />

				<p><strong>General options</strong> menu consist of next sections:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong><em>Retina Ready</em></strong> that menu enables retina ready feature. Be aware that if Retina Ready option is enabled you have to upload your retina ready images and indicate the path for them (i.e. data-srcX2="{{media url="your_media_folder/your_retina_ready_image_img@x2.jpg"}}) otherwise your clients will see nothing on their mobile devices with retina displays</li>

					<li><strong><em>Currency Switcher</em></strong> allows you to choose display mode of currency's choice and activate currency label.

				<h2 class="section-title">Header Slider</h2><br /><br />
				<p>This theme is equipped with header images slider based on <a target="_blank" href="https://iosscripts.com/iosslider/">iosslider</a>. Despite of the fact that this jQuery plugin is chargeable you can use it absolutely for free <strong>with this theme</strong>.</p>
				<p>All available slider options you can find there <em class="dfn-code">Meigee -> Theme Options vX.X -> Header Slider</em></p>
				<p>This slider is based on static blocks which are merged into slider automatically. All demo slides you can find under <em class="dfn-code">Sources/Static Content/Blocks</em>, they called <em class="dfn-code">indigo_slide_X.html</em> for wide slider and <em class="dfn-code">indigo_boxed_slide_X.html</em> for boxed one.</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Upload your slider images on your server, using your favourite FTP client</li>
					<li>Create Static block for each slider image and fill it with content: add slider image to static block by clicking button "Insert Image" at the top of static block content field. Then add your promo text or other content to the slide and save changes. While editing the static blocks for header slider make sure that WYSIWYG editor is disabled. If it is available your slider images' code will be wrapped with tag p and the slider will not be displayed correctly. Be aware that for every slider image you have to create separate Static Block</li>
					<li>When you created all needed static blocks for header slider go to <em class="dfn-code">Meigee-> Theme Options-> Header slider</em> and activate header slider by setting Yes in Enable dropdown menu</li>
					<li>Select the slider type (Boxed or Wide) and in field "Slides" indicate comma separated IDs of previously created static blocks with slider content</li> 
					<li>Configure other slider options (slider timer, auto sliding ...) and save changes</li>
				</ol>
				<h3 class="sub-title">Known problems with header slider</h3>
				<div class="note-2">
				<strong>Slider images aren't displayed correctly</strong><br /><br />
				<em>Solution 1.</em> Disable WYSIWYG editor theme <em class="dfn-code">System -> Configuration -> Content Management</em><br/>
				<em>Solution 2.</em> Check if your images aren't wrapped with html tag &lt;p&gt; like this <em class="dfn-code">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img ... /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</em>. Images must be put without that tags<br/>
				<em>Solution 3.</em> One of your slider images has another proportion than all other header slider images. All of header slider images should have same proportions

							<li>Go to: <em class="dfn-code">Catalog -> Attributes -> Manage Attributes</em> click on "Manufacturer" from attribute list and go to the "Manage Label / Options" tab</li>
							<li>
								Make "Manufacturer" attribute options looking the same as on a following screenshot: <br /><img class="content-img" src="img/manufacturer_attribute_option.png" />
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Fill in option fields with your brand names and save the attribute:</p>
								<img class="content-img" src="img/attribute_options.png" /></li>
							<li>
								Create logo images of your brands with the same names as you set in the previous step. <strong>If you use different names for each store view you have (English, German, Spanish, etc...) you need create images with all of those names.</strong> We recommend to create logo images with same proportions.
							</li>
							<li>Create images for retina ready devices by following rules described in the previous step but with adding @x2. Example: Indigo@x2.png</li>
							<li>
								Put those images to <em class="dfn-code">media/brands</em> folder of your magento. If you do not have that folder, you have to create it. 
							</li>
						</ol>
						After these steps, you can easily display brand logo images using our widget "Brands Showcase" on any CMS page, or show brand logo image on product page. Widget settings that allow to add brands showcase on cms page you will find in subsection <a href="#brand-showcase-widget">Brand Showcase</a> of UI widgets chapter. "Brand logo image" section of <a href="#product-page-options">product page options</a> will help you to display brand logo image on product page.

			<div id="customization" class="post">
				<h2 class="section-title">Customization</h2><br /><br />
				<p>Magento uses parent/child theming concept so our theme is based on default magento theme. It allows to customize any parts of a theme with ease.</p>
				<div class="note-2">You should never modify magento and our theme default template files. This may cause lot's of problems in updating magento core or our theme to the latest version.</div>
				<h3 class="sub-title">How to customize the theme</h3>
				<p>There are two correct ways how you should customize our theme. Choose it based on your needs</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
					<strong>You need to customize css rules only</strong>. In this case you should write your own css rules in <em class="dfn-code">skin/frontend/indigo/default/css/custom.css</em><br />
					Since this file is loaded after any other css files all css rules written in it <strong>will override any others</strong>
					</li>
					<li><strong>You need to customize .js or .phtml files</strong>. In this case the only correct way is creating your own subtheme.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3 class="sub-title">How to create subthemes</h3>
				<p>Creating a subtheme is a correct way of customization our theme. It allows you to update our theme to the latest version with ease. All you will need is <strong>just upload</strong> newest version of the theme  implement changes <strong>in overridden files</strong> in your own subtheme. You can create as many subthemes as you want. You can create specific subthemes for categories or cms pages, etc.</p>
				<p><strong>Default theme folders structure</strong>.<br/>
				<em class="dfn-code">app/design/frontend/<strong>indigo/</strong>default/</em><br/>
				Template files are separated into following folders:<br/>
				<em class="dfn-code">layout</em> - contains XML files which define pages structure<br/>
				<em class="dfn-code">template</em> - contains template .phtml files <br/>
				<em class="dfn-code">locale</em> - contains CSV files with translations<br/><br/>
				<em class="dfn-code">skin/frontend/<strong>indigo/</strong>default/</em><br/>
				Template files are separated into following folders:<br/>
				<em class="dfn-code">css</em> - contains CSS files<br/>
				<em class="dfn-code">images</em> - contains images<br/>
				<em class="dfn-code">js</em> - directory contains JavaScript files<br/><br/>
				Overriding of our extensions is not recommended and this guide doesn't cover it. You may have strong php/Zend knowledges to customize any extensions including ours.</p>
				<p>
				To create your own subtheme you need to create two following folders:<br/>
				<em class="dfn-code">app/design/frontend/indigo/<strong>subtheme/</strong></em><br/>
				<em class="dfn-code">skin/frontend/indigo/<strong>subtheme/</strong></em><br/>
				</p>
				<p>Then you need to copy files which you want to customize into that subtheme keeping folders structure. For example if you need to customize header <em class="dfn-code">app/design/frontend/indigo/default/template/page/html/header.phtml</em> you need to copy it to <em class="dfn-code">app/design/frontend/indigo/<strong>subtheme/</strong>template/page/html/header.phtml</em></p>
				<h3 class="sub-title">How to activate subtheme</h3>
				<p>
				After creating subtheme the way described above you need activate it via the magento admin panel. You can activate different themes for a whole store, categories or pages</p>
				<p><strong>To activate your own subtheme for a whole store go to <em class="dfn-code">System -> Configuration -> Design</strong></em> and fill needed fields like this:</strong><br/>
				<img class="content-img" src="img/admin_design.png" /><br/><br/>
				<p><strong>To activate your own subtheme for a specific category go to <em class="dfn-code">System -> Manage Categories</strong></em>, click on a category you want to change theme for, go to the tab "Custom Design" and choose your own subtheme under indigo group:</strong><br/>
				<img class="content-img" src="img/admin_category_design.png" /><br/><br/>
				<p><strong>To activate your own subtheme for a specific page go to <em class="dfn-code">CMS -> Pages</strong></em>, click on a page you want to change theme for, go to the tab "Design" and choose your own subtheme under indigo group:</strong><br/>
				<img class="content-img" src="img/admin_page_design.png" />
				</p>
				<h3 class="sub-title">How to know which file is used for...</h3>
				Magento has incredible tool for debug provided by default. <br/>
				It can be enabled here <em class="dfn-code">System -> Configuration -> Developer -> Debug</strong></em>. <br/>
				<img class="content-img" src="img/admin_debug.png" /><br/>
				It cannot be enabled for whole store but for specific store view so make sure you have chosen it. <br/><br/>So in frontend you will see something like this:<br/>

				<h2 class="section-title">About Third Party Extensions</h2><br /><br />
				<div class="note-2">There is the only one theme which is fully compatible with any extensions. Default magento theme.</div>
				We tried to make this theme as much compatible with any extensions as possible but it's impossible to get it done for sure due to huge amount of available extensions. So please notice <strong>this theme may not be compatible with some extensions</strong>.
				<h3 class="sub-title">Why the theme can't be compatible with any extensions?</h3>
				<p>The answer is pretty simple: If this theme and an extension use the same template files - <strong>they aren't compatible</strong></p>
				<h3 class="sub-title">Solution?</h3>
				<p>In most of cases the solution is pretty easy too:<br />
				<strong>Move template files of an extension to the theme folder</strong>. This theme is an interface, like <strong>base</strong> or <strong>default</strong> one, so if an extension has folder under <em class="dfn-code">base/<strong>default/</strong></em> or <em class="dfn-code">default/<strong>default/</strong></em> move all of them to <em class="dfn-code">indigo/<strong>default/</strong></em></p>
				<p>But sometimes you also need to edit some template files of an extension or/and of the theme ones to get it working. We strongly do not recommend doing this if you are not familiar to magento, hire professional developers to get it done instead. Please refer to <a href="#custom">Custom Development</a> chapter of this guide for more information.</p>
				<p>Authors of the 3-rd party extensions should provide detailed instruction about how to integrate the extension with custom themes because default magento theme is used only on magento demo, on real stores people use custom themes for sure.</p>
				<h3 class="sub-title">Pre installed third party extensions</h3>

				<strong>IWD one page checkout</strong> has next options: 
				<ol>
					<li><strong><em>General</em></strong> here you can activate custom onepage checkout, entitle that page, choose default payment method, set default country and decide if you want to show shipping address form, newsletter block and comment field on one page checkout page. Same here you can let your customers make orders without being loged in</li>    
					<li><strong><em>GeoIP</em></strong> function allows your customer not to fill such fields as country and city on onepage checkout, that fields will be auto filled based on IP of customer.
